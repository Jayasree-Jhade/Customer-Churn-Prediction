# Customer-Churn-Prediction
This Project refers to the prediction of whether a purticular Customer Ceases his or her relationship with a company.
* To preprocess the given data of records and features
* Developed a deep learning model using Advanced algorithms like Artificial Neural networks classifiers to find the accuracy of model prediction.
* Implemented feature encoding techniques and applied Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to find out best epochs and optimizers.
